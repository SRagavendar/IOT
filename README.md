# IOT
Collection of Arduino sketches for my various projects that I did through my college days and my hobby time.

Abstract
Nowadays Internet of Things (IoT) has become a very hot topic. We can use it to control objects connected to the Internet, thereafter enabling us to collect and exchange data between objects. With its expansion in different field out of which Home Automation is one trend which take us one step ahead toward smart cities. In the proposed project(s) a system is developed which is control via MQTT protocol, which is a lightweight protocol for IoT. Using which we tried to achieve things like controlling appliance from distance, generating alerts based on the data collected. NodeMCU is used as a processor connecting different devices via WiFi channel. We tried to create a home environment and tested our prototype. First we tried it using HTML web page and then moved to application such as MQTTBox and Node-RED dashboard in later part.

Not just that, there are so many different projects done over a period of 3 years : 

1. Party_Glasses
2. Guitar
3. Instagram/YouTube Notifier
4. RADAR
5. Matrix Painter
6. PC Joystick
7. Old Clock Phone
8. Home Automation (working on some updates, will come again)

Upcoming :-
Robot (that is useless, but is fun) Saga : 
1. Chair that throws you off the moment you sit on it.
2. When we open/close a door it'll give off a wierd sound
3. Diagram (lung style) for alexa or siri { so that we can creep off anyone }

If anyone got any ideas, let me know :)
